For nearly 11 years, Hack Club - a nonprofit that provides coding education and community to teenagers worldwide - has used Slack as the tool for communication. We weren't freeloaders. A few years ago, when Slack transitioned us from their free nonprofit plan to a $5,000/year arrangement, we happily paid. It was reasonable, and we valued the service they provided to our community.

However, two days ago, Slack reached out to us and said that if we don't agree to pay an extra $50k **this week** and $200k a year, they'll deactivate our Slack workspace and delete all of our message history.

One could argue that Slack is free to stop providing us the nonprofit offer at any time, but in my opinion, a six month grace period is the _bare minimum_ for a massive hike like this, if not more. Essentially, Salesforce (a **$230 billion** company) is strong-arming a small nonprofit for teens, by providing less than a week to pony up a pretty massive sum of money, or risk cutting off all our communications. That's absurd.

## The impact

The small amount of notice has also been catastrophic for the programs that we run. Dozens of our staff and volunteers are now scrambling to update systems, rebuild integrations and migrate _years_ of institutional knowledge. The opportunity cost of this forced migration is simply staggering.

Anyway, we're moving to Mattermost. This experience has taught us that owning your data is incredibly important, and if you're a small business especially, then I'd advise you move away too.
