## The good ending

Turns out that this post went pretty viral on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45283887) and Twitter/X:

I'm very happy to announce that a couple hours ago, Slack's CEO got in contact with us and offered to put things right (I can't exactly say what it is, but it's better than the plan we were on previously!) A massive thank you to everyone who helped spread awareness - it was incredibly heartwarming to see so many people support us and help get this sorted.

With that being said though, this ordeal has made us think more deeply about entrusting data with external SaaSes and ensuring that we _own_ our data is definitely going to be a very big priority going forward. I'd encourage you to think the same way!

For nearly 11 years, Hack Club - a nonprofit that provides coding education and community to teenagers worldwide - has used Slack as the tool for communication. We weren't freeloaders. A few years ago, when Slack transitioned us from their free nonprofit plan to a $5,000/year arrangement, we happily paid. It was reasonable, and we valued the service they provided to our community.

However, two days ago, Slack reached out to us and said that if we don't agree to pay an extra $50k **this week** and $200k a year, they'll deactivate our Slack workspace and delete all of our message history.

One could argue that Slack is free to stop providing us the nonprofit offer at any time, but in my opinion, a six month grace period is the _bare minimum_ for a massive hike like this, if not more. Essentially, Salesforce (a **$230 billion** company) is strong-arming a small nonprofit for teens, by providing less than a week to pony up a pretty massive sum of money, or risk cutting off all our communications. That's absurd.

## The impact

The small amount of notice has also been catastrophic for the programs that we run. Dozens of our staff and volunteers are now scrambling to update systems, rebuild integrations and migrate _years_ of institutional knowledge. The opportunity cost of this forced migration is simply staggering.

Anyway, we're moving to Mattermost. This experience has taught us that owning your data is incredibly important, and if you're a small business especially, then I'd advise you move away too.

## Update: We're self-hosting Mattermost!

We've started moving to Mattermost, and we're running it ourselves (ty, AGPLv3). This way, our data belongs to us, and there's no risk of it being taken away. The whole community, including the messages, links, and files, is coming with us, and we're going to keep 11 years of conversations safe. This is a big change, but the right one.  

We're also planning to make Mattermost completely our own: custom clients, themes, bots, features, and more. See some of the hacky stuff we've done here:  

- [Jamcast](https://github.com/jeremy46231/jamcast#jamcast) — share music in a Slack huddle; streams from a cooperative Spotify Jam to a Slack huddle and a higher-quality website  
- [SlackScan](https://github.com/3kh0/slackscan) — inspired by TgScan; indexes channels and members to show what channels a user is in  
- [ShipTalkers](https://github.com/SkyfallWasTaken/shiptalkers) — compare Wakatime vs Slack activity  
- [Fraudpheus](https://github.com/budzioT/fraudpheus) — AI-enhanced support ticket app
