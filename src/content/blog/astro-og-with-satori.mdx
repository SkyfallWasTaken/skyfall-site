## Introduction

OpenGraph (OG) images are a good way to do stuff. TODO: me

## Installing dependencies

We'll first need to download the dependencies we need. I'll be using Preact in this tutorial, and of course, we'll need to install Satori.

```bash
npm install preact # or `npm install react`
npm install satori
```

If you're going to use Tailwind and want to use the same Tailwind config, you'll also want to use the `tw-to-css` library. I talk more about this in [my blog post on using Satori with your project's Tailwind config.](/posts/satori-with-tailwind-config)

```bash
npm install tw-to-css
```

Finally, we'll add the Sharp library, which'll convert Satori's SVG output into a PNG.

```bash
npm install sharp
```

If you're using Bun for the above step

## Setting up an `/[slug]/og` endpoint

Assuming that your file structure looks something like this:

```text
/
├── src/
│   ├── blog/
│   │   └── [slug].astro
```

You'll want to move the `[slug].astro` file to a new `[slug]` folder, rename it to `index.astro`, then add a new `og.ts` file in that new folder. Now, here's some code you can put in that file:

```ts
import fs from "fs/promises";
import satori from "satori";
import sharp from "sharp";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
import type { InferGetStaticParamsType } from "astro";

import OpenGraphImage from "path/to/your/og/image/component";

const posts = await getCollection("blog");
type Params = InferGetStaticParamsType<typeof getStaticPaths>;

export async function GET({ params }: { params: Params }) {
  const post = posts.find((post) => post.slug === params.slug); // Find the specific post by slug
  if (!post) {
    return new Response("Post not found", { status: 404 });
  }

  const element = OpenGraphImage(post);
  const png = await PNG(element);
  return new Response(png, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "image/png",
    },
  });
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    props: post,
  }));
}

export async function SVG(component: h.JSX.Element) {
  return await satori(component as any, {
    width: 1200,
    height: 630,
    fonts: [
      {
        name: "Outfit",
        data: await fs.readFile("./src/assets/fonts/og/Outfit-Regular.ttf"),
        weight: 400,
      },
    ],
  });
}

export async function PNG(component: h.JSX.Element) {
  return await sharp(Buffer.from(await SVG(component)))
    .png()
    .toBuffer();
}
```

<div class="not-prose">
  <Card border="border-yellow-500" bg="bg-base">
    If your route param isn't called `slug`, you'll need to change the
    references to `slug` to match your route param.
  </Card>
</div>

We're setting the image size to `1200x630`, which is the recommended size for OG images, and ensures your images look good on most platforms, like Twitter/X and Discord.

You probably also noticed the `fonts` array we're passing to `satori`, which, well, defines the fonts you're going to be using in your image! I've used the [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) font here, but feel free to pick your own. **Note that the relative paths are relative to the root directory of your project.**

## Creating an OG image component

Now, let's create the `OpenGraphImage` component that we're using in the `og.ts` file. This component will be responsible for rendering the actual content of the OG image. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { type CollectionEntry } from "astro:content";

export default function (props: CollectionEntry<"blog">) {
  return (
    <div tw="flex flex-col w-full h-full p-12 items-center text-center justify-center text-white bg-indigo-500">
      <div tw="flex font-bold text-8xl mb-4">{props.data.title}</div>
      <div tw="flex text-5xl mb-12">{props.data.description}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
